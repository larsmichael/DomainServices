# About Domain Services

Domain Services is a lightweight framework for developing service-oriented applications in .NET based on [domain-driven design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) and [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). It provides a collection of generic interfaces and abstract base classes for domain driven design types such as entities, services and repositories.

For an example of how to build a Web API project using Domain Services, see [DomainServicesSample](https://github.com/larsmichael/DomainServicesSample).
